Title: Controlling the steering wheel using Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey

Entrypoint: project_v1.ipynb

Open the project_v1.ipynb file in jupyter-notebook/ any ipython notebook executor.
It will import all the algorithms added in the `ProjectGroup6Algorithms` results for the same are added.

At this point the algorithms that are supported is
    1. Q-Learning/ Q-Networks (Example is on Taxi-v3)
    2. Deep Q-Networks (Example is on CartPole-v1)
    3. Double Deep Q-Networks (Example is on CartPole-v1)
    4. Dueling Double Deep Q-Networks (Example is on CartPole-v1)
